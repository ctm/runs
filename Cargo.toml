# Pinning selectors specifically to 0.22 is necessary, because scraper
# uses selectors and it currently pins to 0.22.  Preferably, I
# wouldn't add selectors as a dependency here at all, but it appears
# necessary for me to be able to use the CaseSensitivity enum, which
# is needed by the has_class method.
